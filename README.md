# pangenome_evoluationary_analysis
a complete workflow for analyzing the pangenomes from the core genesets. simply have to provide the fasta files and it will do everything and will make all the accessory information plots from the evolutionary analysis. It will also check for the breakage in the phylogeny and also will perform the repoint analysis.
