# pangenome_evoluationary_analysis
a complete workflow for analyzing the pangenomes from the core genesets. simply have to provide the fasta files and it will do everything and will make all the accessory information plots from the evolutionary analysis. It will also check for the breakage in the phylogeny and also will perform the repoint analysis. A ruby on rails application is also written which will single point take the slurm address and will give you the graphical analysis for all the evolutionary pangenome. There were some variable declaration to be fixed and if you use this then change the variables accrodingly and if not then check the updated version below with more parameters and support for the other analysis. \

2024-1-26 An update with fixing up the path vairables add the support for the stream library so that it will be much faster and also adding the construction of the super matrix and running the phylogeny and estimation of the ancestral state on the super matrix. \
